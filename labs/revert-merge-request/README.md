## Revert a merge request

You can use Gitâ€™s powerful feature to revert any commit by clicking the Revert button in merge requests and commit details

After you select that button, a modal appears where you can choose to revert the changes directly into the selected branch or you can opt to create a new merge request with the revert changes.

After the merge request has been reverted, the Revert button is no longer available
