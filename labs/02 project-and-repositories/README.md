## Project in GitLab

Projects in GitLab are used to organize your work. You can create projects to host your codebase. You can also use projects to track issues, plan work, collaborate on code, and continuously build, test, and use built-in CI/CD to deploy your app. 

Projects can be available [publicly, internally, or privately](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/public_access.html). GitLab does not limit the number of private projects you can create. 

When you create a new project, an empty git repository is created for you. A GitLab project is the entry point for collaboration between teams. GitLab is a DevOps tool. It enables teams to use DevOps and CI/CD pipelines to build, test, and validate the software products that are being developed.

There are three ways of creating projects in GitLab:

1. Blank Project
2. Using Templates
3. Importing projects from external sources

---------------------------------
## Blank Project

> Click on the "New project" button from the home screen of GitLab (you should be logged in).
