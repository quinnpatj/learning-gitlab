## Subgroups

You can organize GitLab groups into subgroups. You can use subgroups to:

- Separate internal and external organizations. Because every subgroup can have its own visibility level, you can host groups for different purposes under the same parent group.
- Organize large projects. You can use subgroups to give different access to parts of the source code.
- Manage people and control visibility. Give a user a different role for each group they’re a member of.

## To create a new subgroup
1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Groups** and find and select the parent group to add a subgroup to. For the training a `learning` group has already been created

2. On the parent group’s overview page, in the top right, select **New subgroup**.
