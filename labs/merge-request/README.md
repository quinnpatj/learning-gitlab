## Merge Request

There are many different ways to create a merge request. 

> Merge requests are designed around a one-to-one (1:1) branch relationship. Only one open merge request may be associated with a given target branch at a time.

For this Lab we will be using our `my-spring-project` project. From the GitLab dashboard click on the project and select **my-spring-project > Repository > Branches**.

> In the "New merge request" form fill:
1. **Title:** this is auto filled, you can add more relevant information for the reviewer
2. **Description:** More detailed explaination of the changes for the reviewer
3. **Assignee:** Who is creating this merge request, for now select your username.
4. **Reviewer:** Who is going to review this merge request, for now select your username.
5. Click "Create merge request" button
6. A new merge request will be created. Merge the changes to the master branch.
