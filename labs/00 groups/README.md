## Groups

GitLab groups are used to manage one or more related projects at the same time.

You can use groups to manage permissions for your projects. If someone has access to the group, they get access to all the projects in the group.

You can also view all of the issues and merge requests for the projects in the group, and view analytics that show the groupâ€™s activity.

You can use groups to communicate with all of the members of the group at once.

For larger organizations, you can also create subgroups

## To create a new group
