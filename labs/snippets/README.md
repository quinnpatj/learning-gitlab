## Snippets

With GitLab snippets, you can store and share bits of code and text with other users. You can comment on, clone, and use version control in snippets. They can contain multiple files. They also support syntax highlighting, embedding, downloading, and you can maintain your snippets with the snippets API.

GitLab provides two types of snippets:

- **Personal snippets:** Created independent of any project. You can set a visibility level for your snippet: public, internal, or private.
- **Project snippets:** Always related to a specific project. Project snippets can be visible publicly or to only group members. 

## Create snippets 

- **To create a personal snippet**: On the [Snippets dashboard](https://git.nmlv.nml.com/dashboard/snippets), select New snippet, or: 

- **To create a project snippet**: Go to your projectâ€™s page. Select _**Snippets**_ from the left panel, and then click **New snippet** button.
